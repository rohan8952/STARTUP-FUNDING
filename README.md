🧠 Project Storyline

The Indian startup ecosystem has seen rapid growth over the years, with investments flowing into diverse industries such as FinTech, HealthTech, SaaS, E-commerce, Mobility, and Media.
However, raw funding data alone does not provide clarity.
This project was created to transform raw startup funding data into meaningful insights by answering questions such as:
•	How has total startup funding changed year by year?
•	Which investment stages attract the most investors?
•	Which industries receive the highest funding?
•	How do cities like Bengaluru, Chennai, and Ahmedabad compare in terms of investments?
•	How many startups and investors are active in a given year?

The dashboard acts as a decision-support tool for:

•	Aspiring entrepreneurs
•	Investors and analysts
•	Students and researchers
